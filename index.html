You can specify background images<br>
for any visible HTML element.<br>

is specified for a div element.<br>
By default, the background-image<br>
will repeat itself in the direction(s)<br>
where it is smaller than the element<br>
where it is specified. (Try resizing the<br>
browser window to see how the<br>
background image behaves.

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
